# AI ID Card Validator

AI ID Card Validator is an advanced web application that uses AI 🤖, Computer Vision 👁️, and OCR 🔤 to verify the authenticity of identity documents.
It provides enterprise-grade security 🔒, fast processing ⚡, and high accuracy ✅ for document validation.

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 **AI-Powered ID Card Validation**: Uses ONNX deep learning models to classify ID cards as genuine, fake, or suspicious.
- 🔤 **OCR Text Extraction**: Extracts and validates text fields from ID cards using intelligent OCR.
- 🖼️ **Template Matching**: Checks if the ID card matches known templates.
- 🛡️ **Multi-layer Security**: Detects tampering, forgery, and manipulation.
- 🌐 **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for validation and health checks.
- 💻 **Modern Frontend**: Responsive UI for uploading and validating ID cards.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.11+
- 📦 pip

### ⚡ Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd "AI ID Card Validator"
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
2. **Open your browser:**
   - 🏠 Main page: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
   - 🖼️ Validator: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/validator](http://127.0.0.1:8000/validator)

### 📡 API Endpoints
- `GET /` : Main landing page (HTML)
- `GET /validator` : Validator UI page (HTML)
- `POST /validate-id` : Validate an ID card (expects base64 image, returns validation result)
- `GET /health` : Health check
- `GET /version` : API version


### 🔄 How the Validation Pipeline Works
The validation process consists of three main steps:

1. **🧠 Image Classification**
   - The uploaded ID card image is first analyzed by an ONNX-based deep learning model.
   - The model classifies the image as `genuine`, `fake`, or `suspicious` based on visual features.

2. **🔤 OCR Validation**
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is performed on the ID card image.
   - Extracted text fields (such as name, roll number, and college) are validated for correctness and completeness.
   - The college name is checked against an approved list.

3. **🖼️ Template Matching**
   - The system compares the ID card layout and design with standard templates using the template matcher.
   - This step helps detect tampering, forgery, or non-standard document formats.

The results from all three steps are combined to make a final decision, which is returned to the user along with confidence scores.

### 🎯 Usage
- Drag and drop an ID card image on the web UI or use the `/validate-id` API endpoint with a base64-encoded image.
- The system will classify the ID, extract and validate fields, check templates, and return a decision with confidence scores.

## ⚙️ Configuration
- **`config.json`**: Set class names, thresholds, and OCR requirements.
- **`approved_colleges.json`**: List of valid colleges for field validation.
- **`model/image_model.onnx`**: Replace with your own ONNX model if needed.

## Customization
- Update `static/styles.css` for UI changes.
- Add new templates or modify validation logic in `template_matcher.py` and `decision.py`.

## 🧪 Testing
- Place test images in the `photos/` directory.
- Use the `tests/` folder for test scripts.
